    changed:
        added interactive_GHF definition
        added ghf_calc_hubbard definition 
        added rdm_1el_ghf definition
    need to test:
        interactive_GHF
        ghf_calc_hubbard
        rdm_1el_ghf (worried about Ne value)

mf1rdm_timedep_mod:
    changed:
    need to change:
        get_ddt_mf_NOs (not sure what equation its referring to)
        calc_Gmat (check equations and dimensions)
        

fci_mod:

fragment_mod:
    changing: get_Hemb

system_mod:
    changed:
    may need to change:
        get_glob1RDM: currently in restricted formalism; changed to generalized in static/transition/rtog_transition

dynamics_driver: 
    changed:
        added an open file_current command if Vbias == True
    need to change:
        update_ham (need to update make_ham_multi_imp_anderson_realspace_laser to form a generalized hamiltonian; think about spin)
    may need to change:
        print_just_dens (range currently going to frag.Nimp, but need to restructure for GHF; also do not understand what it does)
        print_data (range from frag.Nimp and Nsites; two places)
