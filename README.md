track of changes per commit:

June 17: 
  -  final update of rtog_transitions in /static/transitions.py
  -  updated get_rotmat in order to recreate rotmat per fragment in rtog_transitions rather than converting from old rotmat
  -  added directory of tests (non-interacting, half system as fragment, and old U_quench_1D; all edited versions of U_quench_1D)
