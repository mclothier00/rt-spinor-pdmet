This is an in-development version of spin-generalized real-time density matrix embedding theory (RT-pDMET). For a working version of RT-pDMET in the spin-restricted formalism, please refer to https://github.com/jskretchmer/real_time_pDMET. For questions about the spin-generalized code, please reach out to mclothier3@gatech.edu.
