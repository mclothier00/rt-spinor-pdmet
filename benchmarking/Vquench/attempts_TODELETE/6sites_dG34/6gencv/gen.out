Transitioning from restricted static calculation to generalized dynamic calculation.
currently setting tot_sysem.mf1RDM (and tot_system.glob1RDM) to the reshaped mf1RDM (glob1RDM)... theres also the option of the intialize_GHF call for the mf1RDM and the get_glob1RDM for the glob1RDM
Finished transition, beginning dynamics.
