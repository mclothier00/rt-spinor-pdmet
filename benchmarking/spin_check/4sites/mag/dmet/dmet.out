Final DMET energy = -4.472135954999585
Energy per site for U= 0.0 is: -1.1180339887498962
DMET calculation succesfully converged in 1 iterations
Final difference in global 1RDM = 6.415270642270571e-15

total_time 0.2551138000000037
Transitioning from restricted static calculation to generalized dynamic calculation.
currently setting tot_sysem.mf1RDM (and tot_system.glob1RDM) to the reshaped mf1RDM (glob1RDM)... theres also the option of the intialize_GHF call for the mf1RDM and the get_glob1RDM for the glob1RDM
Finished transition, beginning dynamics.
